Here is an example of how the program would work:

How many Product A's do you want? 2
How many Product B's do you want? 1
How many Product C's do you want? 3
Do you want to gift wrap your purchase? (y/n) y

Product Name | Quantity | Total
Product A | 2 | 40
Product B | 1 | 40
Product C | 3 | 150
Subtotal: 230
Discount: 10
Shipping Fee: 5
Gift Wrap Fee: 3
Total: 222
